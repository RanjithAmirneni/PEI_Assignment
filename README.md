#Test-driven development (TDD):

is a software development process relying on software requirements being 
converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking 
all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all 
test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test 
cases created later. Programmers also apply the concept to improving and 
debugging legacy code developed with older techniques.

```

```bash
Process:

        1. Add a test
        2. Run all tests. The new test should fail for expected reasons
        3. Write the simplest code that passes the new test
        4. All tests should now pass
        5. Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor to ensure that functionality is preserved
            Repeat.
```

```bash

----> Here all the tests are written in Test_Driven_Transformer.ipynb

----> And all the dev and analytical code is maintained in Ecommerce_Sales_Data_Processing_Dev.ipynb

----> This notebook is imported into Test_Driven_Transformer.ipynb and then executed the tests.

----> These notebooks are developed based on assignment given by PEI

----> Each notebook code is written with proper comments, execption handling , print statements, python docstrings.

```
